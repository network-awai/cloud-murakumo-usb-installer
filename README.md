# cloud-murakumo-usb-installer

**Native Murakumo NixOS preview:** [profile, Itonami launcher and VM gates](docs/murakumo-nixos-native-preview.md).
It runs Kaikei and Dandori judgment cores in browser Workers and a native host
observer under systemd. It is an independent VM/live candidate; full network
Node/Cell integration and physical hardware remain separate acceptance work.

NixOS installation media and Murakumo Client setup for Murakumo Nodes.
NixOS is the current operating system. Murakumo Client names the software suite;
Murakumo Node names a participating instance or host. AiueOS is an unfinished
future OS intended to replace NixOS, not the OS delivered by this installer. This repository owns the OS installation boundary: boot media, disk
selection, target configuration, recovery and rollback. The ISO opens a guided
installer on boot: choose Wi-Fi, Ethernet or offline continuation, then select
and approve the internal disk. The bundled OS
is copied and installed without Internet or host-side compilation. Registration
opens the same network guide after the installed PC boots. See
[network onboarding](docs/network-onboarding.md).
The [account-linking guide](docs/account-onboarding.md) continues through a phone
QR, Passkey approval, cancellation/retry and saved versus online-verified status.
The [native graphical guide](docs/graphical-setup.md) describes the new disk cards,
selected-disk confirmation and UUID-based boot routing.
See [the guided installation procedure](docs/automatic-install.md). Initial
password entry is no longer required; see [password-free verification](docs/verification-passwordless-2026-10-05.md).

Status: guided disk installation and account onboarding were added on 2026-10-05. See
[the account onboarding verification record](docs/verification-account-onboarding-2026-10-05.md) for the
reviewed source, ISO hash and VM checks. Physical PC installation, real phone
Passkey linking and inference still require separate verification. The
[2026-09-26 record](docs/verification-2026-09-26.md) describes the earlier manual
installation image.

## Build the bootable ISO

On a NixOS or Linux machine with Nix, use a reviewed nixpkgs checkout at an
explicit commit, or the immutable store path behind a pinned NixOS channel:

```sh
./scripts/build-iso.sh /absolute/path/to/nixpkgs
```

The [VM release gate](docs/vm-release-gate.md) must pass against the same source
and package pin before ISO creation or system-export publication.
The script prints the nixpkgs commit and produces `result/iso/*.iso`. Review
that commit and record the ISO SHA-256 before writing a USB stick. Use the
[official NixOS installation manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/#sec-installation)
for USB writing, partitioning, mounting and `nixos-install`. The ISO includes
the read-only preflight script and target templates under `/etc/murakumo/`,
and the guided installer. Previously written USB sticks must be rewritten with
the new ISO separately, after confirming and approving the USB's erasure.

## Install a target host

The normal path is now [guided installation](docs/automatic-install.md).
The steps below are the manual recovery/custom configuration path.

1. Boot the USB media. Run `sh /etc/murakumo/preflight.sh` to inspect boot
   mode, disks, network interfaces and GPU devices.
2. Identify the intended disk and a recovery path. Partition and mount it
   following the official manual. A wrong disk choice destroys data.
3. Run `nixos-generate-config --root /mnt`. Keep the generated
   `hardware-configuration.nix` for this host.
4. Copy `node-base.nix`, `node-provider.nix`, `node-claim.nix`, `console-ui.nix`, `offline-base.nix`, `offline-uefi.nix`,
   `offline-bios.nix`, `network-setup.mjs`, `setup-ui.mjs`, `registration-ui.mjs`,
   `account-link.mjs`, `local-setup.mjs`, `language.mjs`, `graphical-ui.js`,
   `graphical-dialog.mjs`, `murakumo-logo.svg`, `acoustic-code.mjs`,
   `setup-sound.mjs` and `sound-link.html` from `/etc/murakumo/` to
   `/mnt/etc/nixos/`, along with
   an edited `configuration.example.nix` renamed to `configuration.nix`. For
   the guided network screen, set `networking.networkmanager.enable = true`
   and `networking.useDHCP = false` in that edited configuration. Set a real
   SSH public key, confirm UEFI or replace the boot loader settings, and review
   the network and filesystem configuration before `nixos-install`.
5. Reboot from the installed disk. Confirm remote access, RADV/Vulkan and
   the chosen model server on physical hardware. Then install the node CLI
   from [cloud-murakumo-installer](https://github.com/network-awai/cloud-murakumo-installer).

## Opt in to idle inference after buyer claim

The base profile leaves both the claim responder and provider service disabled.
Before shipping, provision each physical device with its own DID and Ed25519
private key, register that DID and its matching claim token with the site, and
put the claim URL or QR code on that device's label. The factory key must never
appear on the label or in the Nix store. The registered DID and device identity
must match. This process still requires a real device and site registration;
installing the OS alone cannot produce a claimable unit.

Once the CLI release is published, install its verified launcher outside home
directories so the restricted service can run it:

```sh
sudo env MURAKUMO_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/murakumo-cli \
  MURAKUMO_BIN_DIR=/opt/murakumo-bin sh install.sh
sudo test -f /var/lib/murakumo/device-identity.json
sudo env MURAKUMO_NODE_IDENTITY_FILE=/var/lib/murakumo/device-identity.json \
  /opt/murakumo-bin/murakumo node doctor \
  --model YOUR_EXACT_MODEL_ID --local-url http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1
```

The factory identity file must be private (mode `0600`) and match the DID
registered for this physical device. Never replace it with another identity
after the buyer claim. To let the device answer the buyer's short-lived claim
challenge, enable the responder on the target after the published CLI is
installed:

```nix
services.murakumoClaimResponder.enable = true;
```

Run `sudo nixos-rebuild switch` and check
`systemctl status murakumo-claim-responder.timer`. The timer calls
`murakumo node claim-once` every 15 seconds and signs only the pending
challenge for this DID. It uses systemd's private credentials and does not
require a model server or buyer password. The buyer must still complete the
claim in their browser. A local `claim-once` success only proves that the
device responded to a challenge; it does not prove that ownership changed.

After the buyer claim and a local `doctor` check, an exact model must be
running locally before idle inference can be enabled. Add this to the target's
`configuration.nix`:

```nix
services.murakumoProvider = {
  enable = true;
  name = "murakumo-node";
  model = "YOUR_EXACT_MODEL_ID";
  localUrl = "http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1";
  idleOnly = true;
};
```

Run `sudo nixos-rebuild switch`, then inspect
`systemctl status murakumo-provider` and
`journalctl -u murakumo-provider -b`. The unit waits for the network, restarts
after a failure and reads the identity through systemd's private credentials.
It does not download a model, bypass admission or guarantee a paid job. If the
model server needs a private API token, configure that separately before
enabling the service; this template does not embed one in the Nix store.

The 2026-09-26 NixOS 26.05 VM pilot booted and ran Murakumo CLI help, but its
GPU was llvmpipe. Bare-metal Radeon 680M, Prism Vulkan, model throughput,
concurrency and restart recovery remain unverified. Keep the serving Ubuntu
installation until those checks and a recovery plan succeed.

`cloud-murakumo-installer` owns the macOS/Linux CLI installation script;
`cloud-murakumo-usb-installer` owns NixOS boot media and OS installation.
Windows node installation is a separate future platform path and is not
advertised as supported by the current CLI script.

## Passwordless account registration

The example enables `services.murakumoAccountLink.enable`. On the installed system,
TTY1 shows a five-minute QR/device code and the public Device ID. Scan it with a phone,
compare the full Device ID, and open the canonical `auth.kotoba.cloud` signer.
Approve with a user-owned Base-account Passkey or an external wallet connected
through Privy. Privy sessions and historical cookies do not grant Node ownership.
The node does not request an account ID/password. Administrative SSH access is configured
separately with the operator's public key; account linking does not grant remote shell access.

The node keeps a local signing key with mode 0600 and a public registration receipt.
Before saving ownership it independently verifies the user proof against the
original Node, flow, challenge and expiry, including current Base-chain verification.
A server `registered` projection alone is refused. The generated verifier's
source commit and digest are recorded in `nixos/node-root-receipt-provenance.json`.
On reboot it loads the previously verified local record and checks online status;
this is not a fresh user ceremony or a claim of fresh chain verification on every boot.
Legacy receipts are preserved but require fresh user proof. Revocation fails closed; an intentional local
relink uses `node /etc/murakumo/account-link.mjs --relink`, preserving the device key.
No model service or fleet worker is enabled by account linking.

This requires the matching dedicated registration Worker, canonical signer and
database migration to be published. Synthetic proof qualification exercised the
compiled verifier and Node persistence with live Base RPC and an unfunded test
wallet; its registration transport was a fixture. It does not verify a real
phone Passkey ceremony, deployment or fleet admission.

Run `node --test test/*.test.mjs` for registration and offline/disk safety tests.
On Linux with the pinned NixOS channel, run `bash scripts/check-install-config.sh`
to parse and evaluate both generated boot configurations with Nix.

## Product names and roles

- **NixOS**: current operating system, installation and system updates.
- **Murakumo Client**: software suite installed and configured on NixOS.
- **Murakumo Daemon**: name for the resident participation process, when supplied.
- **Murakumo CLI**: command interface; **Murakumo App**: user-facing application.
- **Murakumo Node**: running participant, host and its observed status.
- **AiueOS**: future replacement OS; incomplete and not delivered here.

The journey is **Install NixOS → Set up Murakumo Client → Participate as a
Murakumo Node**. Local configuration and account linking alone do not prove a
running daemon, inference readiness or fleet admission. See
[naming and compatibility](docs/product-naming.md).

## Local setup and startup language

Startup offers Japanese and English. The installed guide can complete local setup
without a phone, an account or Internet, preserving its device identity across boots.
Account linking remains an explicit later choice. See
[local setup](docs/local-setup-and-updates.md) and [the integrated update lifecycle](docs/os-update-lifecycle.md).
Signed OS update services require owner provisioning; see [operations](docs/update-operations.md).
Updating a USB does not update an
already installed PC.

## Setup audio

The startup language page plays a quiet, original ambient piece with a visible
stop/replay control. The QR page can send the same expiring approval code by sound.
See [sound linking](docs/sound-linking.md) for the included companion reader,
Passkey approval boundary and public-release/physical-phone qualification gaps.

## Bluetooth Wi-Fi provisioning

The network chooser offers Bluetooth when a controller is present. Opening it
creates a ten-minute, one-use secret shown locally as a QR code or a masked key.
The companion encrypts Wi-Fi credentials with HKDF/AES-GCM before sending
fragmented GATT writes; expired, modified and replayed messages are refused.
Closing the page stops advertising. This transfers Wi-Fi settings only; account
ownership still requires the separate Passkey flow.

`nixos/ble-setup.nix` integrates the services into the next installer build.
`scripts/install-ble-host.sh` installs the Ubuntu adapter on the explicitly
selected existing node. Its services start at boot but do not advertise until
a setup window is opened. `scripts/serve-ble-client.mjs` provides a localhost
companion for Mac Chrome testing; it is not a published phone application.

On 2026-10-07, 6600hs-2 registered the GATT service and started/stopped its
advertisement. The live controller accepted WebCrypto-encrypted, fragmented
settings, reconnected its existing Wi-Fi, refused replay and removed its consumed
secret. That test uses private local IPC, not a Bluetooth radio transfer.
The Mac Bluetooth chooser did not discover the node, so radio transfer and
physical-phone setup remain unverified. An iPhone native companion, public
HTTPS companion deployment, Nix runtime evaluation and USB rewrite are not
included in this host verification. See the machine-readable evidence under
`docs/evidence/ble-setup-2026-10-07/`.

### Kekkai SSH during installation

The live installer and installed client support [8-digit, locally approved
Kekkai SSH](docs/kekkai-install-ssh.md) before Passkey or account registration.
The manager pins the Node certificate and both public keys; approved SSH and
Kekkai identities survive installation and reboot. The release gate tests the
real encrypted overlay with direct LAN SSH blocked.
