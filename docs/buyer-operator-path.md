# Murakumo Node buyer and operator path

This records what the current code supports after an operator installs NixOS.
It is not a claim that retail units are preconfigured. The ISO does not install
a model, expose a buyer chat UI, or pair a Kotoba authority account. Current
source adds a `murakumo.cloud` factory claim responder to the installed NixOS
node, but no new ISO or physical unit has been verified with it.

| Stage | Current action | Completion evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Purchase and delivery | Retail ordering and physical fulfillment happen outside this installer. | A delivered, configured unit is inspected against the sold specification. |
| OS install | Operator boots the USB, selects and installs a target disk using the NixOS manual. | Installed host boots from its own disk and remote access works. |
| Local AI | Operator supplies an OpenAI-compatible model server and reviewed model. | `node /etc/murakumo/node-readiness.mjs --model MODEL_ID --local-url http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1` returns success from that exact model. |
| Factory identity | On each installed unit, the operator provisions a unique Ed25519 device key and label, then registers the factory DID and token with the operator-only `murakumo.cloud` API near dispatch. | The private key stays on the device; a distinct printed label and a factory row exist for that unit. |
| Buyer device claim | The buyer signs in at `murakumo.cloud`, scans the label, and the powered-on node signs the pending challenge. The node then sends signed heartbeats. | The site records a single claimed owner and a fresh signed heartbeat. This is a site device claim, separate from `auth.kotoba.cloud` authority pairing. |
| Optional community participation | Operator installs a Murakumo CLI version that supports `MURAKUMO_NODE_IDENTITY_FILE`, then runs `doctor`, `check`, and foreground `join` with the factory device identity. Do not run `node init` for a factory-provisioned unit. | The Community node reports the same DID as the buyer-claimed device, followed by admission and a fresh model-ready heartbeat. These do not prove job placement. |
| Rewards | Inference credits and reward accounting are separate from CLI join. | A completed, accepted job and an actual reward ledger entry are needed. No automatic reward or cash redemption is implemented by this installer. |

The supported command sequence for the CLI is documented in
[`kotoba-lang/murakumo`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/murakumo). The local
readiness check does not mutate the model server or contact the community. It
accepts only a loopback HTTP `/v1` URL, verifies that the exact model ID is
listed, and requests a short chat completion. It does not establish GPU
acceleration, throughput, restart recovery or hardware suitability.

After installing a reviewed NixOS configuration that imports `node-base.nix`,
the operator runs the following on each unit. `provision` refuses to replace an
existing identity. The file containing the device private key and factory token
is root-readable only; keep the printed registration JSON and QR URL private
until the unit is prepared for its buyer.

```sh
sudo node /etc/murakumo/device-claim.mjs provision --model 'Murakumo 2609'
sudo systemctl start murakumo-device-claim
sudo systemctl status murakumo-device-claim
```

The operator sends the returned `registration` JSON to
`POST https://murakumo.cloud/api/devices/register` using the site admin token
from a trusted operator environment, never from the node. The factory claim
window is 30 days from registration, so register near dispatch. The printed
`labelUrl` is the QR content. If a label must be reprinted, run
`sudo node /etc/murakumo/device-claim.mjs label` on that same unit. The buyer
opens that URL, signs in with the site's Passkey flow, scans/submits the label,
and keeps the node powered and online while it answers the five-minute
challenge. A successful claim changes the site device row to `claimed`; a
subsequent signed heartbeat confirms that the same key is online. A heartbeat
reports identity/liveness only, not model readiness or inference capability.

The site claim and the Community inference provider can use the same device
identity when the CLI is started with the root-readable factory identity file.
This binds their device DID, but does not delegate the device's earned credits
to the buyer's account. A claimed buyer unit is not automatically a paid
provider. Joining Community still needs its own admission, an accepted
completed inference job, and a reward ledger entry before any reward can be
asserted.

After installing the updated Murakumo CLI, run it as root for this check so
the private factory key never needs a copy in a user's home directory. Use
the exact model ID returned by the local model server; replace the example
value below. `check` enrolls and reports a heartbeat without taking jobs.
Only after the operator has admitted the Community node and confirmed the
model should `join` be used for unattended participation. The NixOS module
keeps Community participation disabled by default. To opt in, install the CLI
release that supports `--idle-only` and add this to the host configuration:

```nix
services.murakumoCommunity = {
  enable = true;
  cli = "/opt/murakumo/bin/murakumo";
  model = "YOUR_MODEL_ID";
  localUrl = "http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1";
};
```

The service checks a real local completion before starting, reuses the factory
DID, and withholds new Community jobs and free-slot heartbeats while the host
has high CPU load or low free memory. A job already claimed is allowed to
finish. Disable the option and rebuild the host to stop participation. This
host check does not see every GPU-only workload, so physical coexistence and
buyer control still need validation before a retail promise.

```sh
sudo env MURAKUMO_NODE_IDENTITY_FILE=/var/lib/murakumo/device-identity.json \
  murakumo node doctor --model YOUR_MODEL_ID
sudo env MURAKUMO_NODE_IDENTITY_FILE=/var/lib/murakumo/device-identity.json \
  murakumo node check --model YOUR_MODEL_ID
sudo env MURAKUMO_NODE_IDENTITY_FILE=/var/lib/murakumo/device-identity.json \
  murakumo node join --model YOUR_MODEL_ID
```

After the same DID has served an accepted paid job, the person operating the
unit can inspect its earned credits. A payout request needs two independent
approvals: the buyer signs in to the draft `murakumo.cloud` device console and
authorizes one exact destination and credit amount, then the device signs the
same request. The buyer copies the two-minute authorization into a private
mode-0600 file on the node. The credits are debited when the API accepts the
request; an operator must separately approve and settle the USDC transfer.
This cross-service path passed a local integration test with a model fixture,
but the site/API changes are draft and are not a live payout flow.

```sh
sudo env MURAKUMO_NODE_IDENTITY_FILE=/var/lib/murakumo/device-identity.json \
  murakumo node earnings
sudo env MURAKUMO_NODE_IDENTITY_FILE=/var/lib/murakumo/device-identity.json \
  murakumo node payout --credits 5000 --to YOUR_0x_WALLET_ADDRESS \
  --owner-token-file /absolute/private/buyer-authorization.txt
```

Only a qualified Community node can take explicitly public work. The current
node worker can execute a `full-shard` job with `input.trust-tier=public` and
the exact local model ID; private `host-large-model` jobs remain outside the
Community pool. This has been exercised only with a local model fixture; an
accepted job on a shipped unit remains an open acceptance check.

Once that check passes, a user on the node can call the same local API. For
example, with a server on port 11434:

```sh
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"YOUR_MODEL_ID","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"こんにちは"}],"stream":false}'
```

This is a local API call, not an account-backed Murakumo chat experience.
Access from a phone or browser needs a separately designed authenticated
interface; do not expose the loopback model server directly to the Internet.

The `murakumo.cloud/onprem` standard retail specification and the separate
24 GB/256 GB Murakumo 2609 listing must be qualified independently. A model
tested on one hardware configuration is not automatically qualified on the
other. Before advertising a turn-key buyer flow, validate the shipped unit's
image, model license and digest, local endpoint, account linking, recovery and
support path on physical hardware.
