# Revised ISO build and VM boot verification — 2026-09-30 JST

## Image identity

- Installer PR: [#1](https://github.com/network-awai/cloud-murakumo-usb-installer/pull/1), source head `b93a8e8bb26ad24e3942fc18950eafa727e8449f`.
- GitHub Actions [run 36590510532](https://github.com/network-awai/cloud-murakumo-usb-installer/actions/runs/36590510532): `build-iso` succeeded. The pull-request checkout recorded merge revision `db0897acc353102e394ffb8089a8b72683d5e195`; this is the exact build input, rather than the branch head alone.
- Pinned nixpkgs revision: `f5c082a40f7571c266e74e80ae2e68aadd8a9fc7`.
- Image: `nixos-minimal-26.05pre-git-x86_64-linux.iso`, 1,535,967,232 bytes.
- SHA-256: `762c179f92a15f9456d6272600878daf1bfe706eb04029ccfbb0bc158ccabcad`.
- The run uploaded the ISO and identity files as artifact `murakumo-installer-db0897acc353102e394ffb8089a8b72683d5e195` (three-day retention). After downloading, the local image hash and size matched the uploaded `iso.sha256` and `iso-size.txt` files.

## Boot checks

The downloaded image booted from its own El Torito/ISOLINUX path in a QEMU x86-64 BIOS guest and from its EFI boot path in a separate QEMU/EDK2 guest. Both reached the NixOS 26.05pre-git automatic-login shell. These VMs used software CPU emulation on macOS, 3 GiB RAM and two vCPUs. The screenshots are retained in the local verification directory alongside the downloaded image.

For an interactive serial-console check, the same image was mounted as a QEMU CD-ROM and its own serial boot kernel/initrd arguments were used. `systemctl is-system-running` returned `running`; `systemctl --failed` listed zero failed units. `/etc/murakumo/` contained `community.nix`, `node-base.nix`, `configuration.example.nix`, `device-claim.mjs`, `node-readiness.mjs` and `preflight.sh`. Both `.mjs` files passed Node 22 `--check`. The bundled `preflight.sh` completed, listed the CD-ROM, network and emulated GPU, and reported that no disk was modified. No target disk was attached to any VM.

## Isolated target-disk installation

A second UEFI QEMU guest had only the original `762c179f...` ISO described above and a newly created, empty 16 GiB qcow2 virtio disk. `lsblk` identified the disk as `/dev/vda`; no physical or host disk was passed to QEMU. After an IPv4 connection to `cache.nixos.org` returned HTTP 200, the VM created a GPT table on `/dev/vda`, a 512 MiB FAT32 EFI partition and an ext4 root partition. Both partitions were mounted under `/mnt`, and `nixos-generate-config --root /mnt` generated the hardware configuration. The ISO's `node-base.nix`, `community.nix`, two Node scripts and example configuration were copied into `/mnt/etc/nixos/`.

The VM-only configuration added an initial test password for the `operator` account and `console=ttyS0,115200n8` for serial inspection; neither value is in the repository template or shipped ISO. `nixos-install --root /mnt --no-root-password` completed with `installation finished!`, installed systemd-boot and created the UEFI `Linux Boot Manager` entry. A second idempotent install applied the serial boot argument and also completed. The installer VM powered off normally.

The ISO was then removed. The same guest booted from the virtual disk alone into `murakumo-node` and accepted the VM-only operator login. `systemctl is-system-running` returned `running`; `systemctl --failed` listed zero units. `murakumo-device-claim.service` was loaded but inactive with `ConditionResult=no`, because no factory identity had been provisioned. `murakumo-community.service` was not found, as participation defaults to disabled. The installed `/etc/murakumo/` contained the claim and readiness scripts, and both passed Node 22 syntax checks. After a normal guest shutdown, `qemu-img check` reported no image errors. The local qcow2 is a test artifact containing only an isolated VM installation and VM-only credentials.

The source's Node 22 factory-claim and local-model-readiness tests passed 8/8 before this build. This proves a manual UEFI VM install and disk-only boot from that ISO. It does not prove Wi-Fi phone setup, a real model, an owner claim, Community admission, GPU inference or payout. Physical USB boot and installation on the Murakumo 2609/6600HS hardware remain unverified. Keep the serving Ubuntu installation and any customer disk unchanged until those checks and a recovery path succeed.

## Factory CLI entrypoint repair

The installed VM exposed a runtime bug in the original ISO: invoking `/etc/murakumo/device-claim.mjs provision` through NixOS's `/etc` symlink exited with status zero but made no identity file and printed no registration. Its main guard compared the symlink path with the resolved module URL as raw strings. A new Node test reproduced the missing file, then passed after the guard compared canonical real paths; the full claim/readiness suite passed 9/9.

Installer source head `769dd5c782a6123083a6d7576e960b2d25b62244` passed [ISO run 36604682618](https://github.com/network-awai/cloud-murakumo-usb-installer/actions/runs/36604682618). The corrected PR merge source was `6ba3b065281285013d52b65a5dfdcb88fa8ec869`; its 1,535,967,232-byte ISO had SHA-256 `7a140e25823f5898faa56c784e926f73cf34b2e2f430e58c71a728915dfbf8fc`. After downloading, the local file matched the uploaded hash. In a no-disk serial VM boot of that corrected ISO, invoking its `/etc/murakumo/device-claim.mjs` through the actual symlink created a 0600 identity file and emitted a registration with a `did:key:z6Mk…` DID, `factory` state and a label URL. The output was kept local to the VM. The guest powered off normally.

The installed qcow2 test disk still contains the older ISO's script and cannot serve as proof that the corrected script runs after target-disk installation. A fresh install or package upgrade from the corrected ISO remains to be tested before physical provisioning. The workflow now runs the symlink regression test before ISO construction.
