# Murakumo NixOS

Follow the workspace-level AGENTS.md architecture and Linear tracking rules.
The native product entry is `nixos/murakumo-nixos.nix`. Keep it separate from
the historical `node-base.nix` setup/provider/update closure. Never add those
Node.js tools as a native profile fallback, and do not stop existing services.

- Compile the monitor and dapp cores with the digest-pinned Amu selfhost native
  compiler in `nixos/native-sources.json`. No JVM, nbb, KBB, babashka, Node.js
  compiler, C compiler or C loader in this build/execution route.
- Nix and its platform build shell package artifacts; this is not a claim that
  the general installer, compiler project linker or CDCI controller is native.
- Static localhost nginx serves only immutable app files. Browser JavaScript
  owns UI/local state and a Worker executes selfhost-produced Wasm. Copy the
  exact pinned canonical `wasm-webcomponent/src/kotoba-client-runtime.js`.
  Current external operations are empty. Changes must follow the shared
  operation-consent contract, never a product-local broker.
- Keep observations outside the static root. Unsigned snapshots are neither
  admission nor execution permission. Unknown Cell/peer state stays unknown.
- Do not describe the observer as a complete Awai Node, hata conductor,
  distributed state system, model provider or qualified economic participant.
- Live sessions must warn that browser state is temporary. Validate recovery
  files and refuse to overwrite existing work. Preserve unreadable data.
- Use the pinned NixOS VM gates before claiming boot/restart/desktop behavior.
  Keep source, build, VM, physical hardware and published releases separate.

The new gate is `nixos/tests/native-workspace.nix` (add `--arg desktop true`
for Cage/Chromium/OCR). No old JVM/nbb workflow is added or retained as a
fallback. Historical setup/provider/voice/update tests do not qualify this
native profile, and this profile does not replace their release/signing gate.
Physical GPU/firmware, networking, full Cell execution, distributed app state
and production keys remain independent acceptance work.

Installed native OS network updates are an opt-in platform administration route
in `nixos/network-update.nix`, qualified separately by
`nixos/tests/network-update.nix`. Nix/systemd/OpenSSH/shell here manage the OS;
they do not replace native app/Node logic or use the historical SCI/Node updater.
Do not enable remote access, generate keys, accept changed SSH host keys, update
live USB sessions or claim early-kernel hardware watchdog recovery. Preserve the
old persistent boot default until an actual one-shot trial has booted and the
authorized operator confirms its exact ID after local health. Never make a
production update or USB refresh a side effect of building/testing this module.
